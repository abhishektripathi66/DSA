#  A Beginner's Guide to Tree Traversal: BFS
#######################################################


1. Definition: What is Breadth-First Search (BFS)?

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a tree traversal algorithm that explores the tree level by level. It visits all the nodes at the current depth before moving on to the nodes at the next depth.

Think of it like exploring a family tree: you meet the parent first, then all of their children (the siblings), and only then do you meet all of their grandchildren. You explore the tree in wide, horizontal layers.

2. How BFS Works: The Queue

BFS uses a data structure called a Queue to keep track of the nodes to visit next. A queue follows a "First-In, First-Out" (FIFO) principle, just like a line at a grocery store. The first person to get in line is the first person to be served.

This is perfect for BFS because we want to visit nodes in the order we discover them.

3. The BFS Algorithm

1.  Create an empty queue.
2.  Add the root node to the queue.
3.  Start a loop that continues as long as the queue is not empty.
4.  Inside the loop:
    a. Remove the node from the front of the queue. Let's call it 'currentNode'.
    b. "Visit" the currentNode (e.g., print its value).
    c. Add all of currentNode's children (from left to right) to the back of the queue.

4. Example Traversal

Let's use this tree:

          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \   \
      4   5   6

- Initial Step: Queue = [1]
- Step 1: Remove 1, Visit 1. Add its children (2, 3).
  - Traversal Order: 1
  - Queue: [2, 3]
- Step 2: Remove 2, Visit 2. Add its children (4, 5).
  - Traversal Order: 1, 2
  - Queue: [3, 4, 5]
- Step 3: Remove 3, Visit 3. Add its child (6).
  - Traversal Order: 1, 2, 3
  - Queue: [4, 5, 6]
- Step 4: Remove 4, Visit 4. It has no children.
  - Traversal Order: 1, 2, 3, 4
  - Queue: [5, 6]
- Step 5: Remove 5, Visit 5. It has no children.
  - Traversal Order: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
  - Queue: [6]
- Step 6: Remove 6, Visit 6. It has no children.
  - Traversal Order: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
  - Queue: []

The queue is now empty, and the loop ends.

Final BFS Traversal Order: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
