Doubly Linked List Documentation
A Doubly Linked List (DLL) is a linear data structure where each node contains three fields: data, 
a reference to the next node, and a reference to the previous node. Unlike a singly linked list,
 a DLL allows traversal in both directions—forward and backward.

Two Components:

Node:
1. Contains data.
2. Contains a reference to the next node (next) and the previous node (prev).

Head Node:
1. The first node in the list.
2. If the list is empty, the head is null.

Operations:
1. Insertion:
New nodes can be inserted at the end of the list.
Traversal happens from the head node to the end, where the new node is appended.

2. Deletion:
Deletes a node with a specific value.
Traverses the list to find the node, and updates the next and prev pointers to remove the node.

3. Traversal:
Forward Traversal: Starts from the head and moves toward the end using the next pointer.
Backward Traversal: Starts from the last node and moves backward using the prev pointer.

4. Search:
Searches for a node with a given data value.
Traverses the list to find the node and returns true if found, otherwise false.


Time Complexity:

Insertion:
O(n) in the worst case, as you may need to traverse the entire list to insert at the end.

Deletion:
O(n) to locate the node to delete (as traversal is required).

Traversal:
O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list.

Search:
O(n), since you may need to traverse the entire list to find a specific node.
