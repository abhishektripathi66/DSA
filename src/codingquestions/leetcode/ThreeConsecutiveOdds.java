Hint
Given an integer array arr, return true if there are three consecutive odd numbers in the array. Otherwise, return false.
 

Example 1:

Input: arr = [2,6,4,1]
Output: false
Explanation: There are no three consecutive odds.
Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,2,34,3,4,5,7,23,12]
Output: true
Explanation: [5,7,23] are three consecutive odds.
 

Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 1000
1 <= arr[i] <= 1000
*/
public class ThreeConsecutiveOdds {
    public boolean threeConsecutiveOdds(int[] arr) {
        for (int i = 2; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (arr[i - 2] % 2 == 1 && arr[i - 1] % 2 == 1 && arr[i] % 2 == 1)
                return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
