 * 2109. Adding Spaces to a String
 * Solved
 * Medium
 * Topics
 * Companies
 * Hint
 * You are given a 0-indexed string s and a 0-indexed integer array spaces that describes the indices in the original string where spaces will be added. Each space should be inserted before the character at the given index.
 * <p>
 * For example, given s = "EnjoyYourCoffee" and spaces = [5, 9], we place spaces before 'Y' and 'C', which are at indices 5 and 9 respectively. Thus, we obtain "Enjoy Your Coffee".
 * Return the modified string after the spaces have been added.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: s = "LeetcodeHelpsMeLearn", spaces = [8,13,15]
 * Output: "Leetcode Helps Me Learn"
 * Explanation:
 * The indices 8, 13, and 15 correspond to the underlined characters in "LeetcodeHelpsMeLearn".
 * We then place spaces before those characters.
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: s = "icodeinpython", spaces = [1,5,7,9]
 * Output: "i code in py thon"
 * Explanation:
 * The indices 1, 5, 7, and 9 correspond to the underlined characters in "icodeinpython".
 * We then place spaces before those characters.
 * Example 3:
 * <p>
 * Input: s = "spacing", spaces = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6]
 * Output: " s p a c i n g"
 * Explanation:
 * We are also able to place spaces before the first character of the string.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * 1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105
 * s consists only of lowercase and uppercase English letters.
 * 1 <= spaces.length <= 3 * 105
 * 0 <= spaces[i] <= s.length - 1
 * All the values of spaces are strictly increasing.
