/**
 * 2859. Sum of Values at Indices With K Set Bits
 * Solved
 * Easy
 * Topics
 * Companies
 * Hint
 * You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer k.
 * <p>
 * Return an integer that denotes the sum of elements in nums whose corresponding indices have exactly k set bits in their binary representation.
 * <p>
 * The set bits in an integer are the 1's present when it is written in binary.
 * <p>
 * For example, the binary representation of 21 is 10101, which has 3 set bits.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: nums = [5,10,1,5,2], k = 1
 * Output: 13
 * Explanation: The binary representation of the indices are:
 * 0 = 0002
 * 1 = 0012
 * 2 = 0102
 * 3 = 0112
 * 4 = 1002
 * Indices 1, 2, and 4 have k = 1 set bits in their binary representation.
 * Hence, the answer is nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 13.
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: nums = [4,3,2,1], k = 2
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: The binary representation of the indices are:
 * 0 = 002
 * 1 = 012
 * 2 = 102
 * 3 = 112
 * Only index 3 has k = 2 set bits in its binary representation.
 * Hence, the answer is nums[3] = 1.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
 * 1 <= nums[i] <= 105
 * 0 <= k <= 10
